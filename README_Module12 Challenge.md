# Written Analysis of the Belly Button BioDiversity challenge Module 12

## Overview of Analysis
This project purpose is to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons. This dashboard is used by the researcher to test hypothesis that bacteria found in human belly button can be synthesised to provide food tasting close to beef (Synthesis beef production). The project also focusses on deploying this dashboard to a cloud server using GitHub Pages.  

Data Source: 
![Belly button Jason data](https://github.com/archinarula/Belly_button/blob/main/samples.json)


## Deliverable/Results: This analysis consists of four technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard


## Results

The interactive dashboard looks like below and is deployed at the URL: https://archinarula.github.io/Belly_button/index.html
