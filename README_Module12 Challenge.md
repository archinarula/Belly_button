# Written Analysis of the Belly Button BioDiversity challenge Module 12

## Overview of Analysis
This project purpose is to build an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons. This dashboard is used by the researcher to test hypothesis that bacteria found in human belly button can be synthesised to provide food tasting close to beef (Synthesis beef production). The project also focusses on deploying this dashboard to a cloud server using GitHub Pages.

## Deliverable/Results: 
This analysis consists of four technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart (Section 1 of the charts.js file)

- Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart (Section 2 of the charts.js file)

- Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart (Section 3 of the charts.js file)

- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard (Chart headings are bolded, charts have brief description at bottom which are italics, jumbotron has custom image added, Jumbotron headings have custom font and colour)


## Results

The interactive dashboard looks like below and is deployed at the URL: https://archinarula.github.io/Belly_button/index.html
